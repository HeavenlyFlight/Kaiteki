# Building Kaiteki

## Prerequisites

- [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
  - Kaiteki is running on the Flutter **master** branch. Prefer checking the [SDK releases page](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/sdk/releases).
  - Change the branch of your Flutter SDK installation with `flutter channel master` and then `flutter upgrade`.
- [Melos](https://pub.dev/packages/melos)
  - Kaiteki uses melos for managing dart projects as a monorepo
- A supported IDE like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) *(optional)*
- Build tools for the platform you want to compile for
  - **Android:** See Flutter "Getting Started" guide for setting up the Android SDK, otherwise download <https://developer.android.com/studio#command-line-tools-only> and set SDK path with `flutter config --android-studio-dir`
  - **Windows:** [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022) with "Desktop development with C++" workload
  - **Linux:**
    - **Debian-based:** `clang cmake ninja-build pkg-config libgtk-3-dev liblzma-dev libhandy-1-dev`
    - **Void Linux:** `clang cmake ninja pkg-config gtk+3-devel libhandy1-devel`

## Cloning and updating submodules

> **Note**
> Kaiteki stores its translations inside **another repository** and includes them via a **submodule**, so it's important to update and initialize them before compiling.

```
git clone https://github.com/Kaiteki-Fedi/Kaiteki.git
git submodule update --init
```

## Preparing the project

```sh
$ melos bootstrap # Bootstrap melos and get packages
melos bootstrap

$ melos run build_runner # (Re-)generated generated source code
melos run build_runner

     └> RUNNING

Select a package to run the build_runner script:

1) * [Default - Press Enter]
2) fediverse_objects
3) kaiteki
4) kaiteki_core
5) kaiteki_core_backends
6) kaiteki_unicode_generator

# press enter to build all (default)
```

## Compiling

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't forget the build flavor
> 
> Kaiteki uses builds flavors in its Android builds. Flutter can't detect them by itself, so you need to pass `--flavor unsignedfoss` (no app signing + FOSS build) for Flutter to properly detect where the app has been built.
>
> The same applies when trying to debug.

```sh
$ flutter build apk --flavor unsignedfoss # Build for Android

Running Gradle task 'assembleUnsignedfossRelease'...            
Font asset "materialdesignicons-webfont.ttf" was tree-shaken, reducing it from 1004940 to 1388 bytes (99.9% reduction). Tree-shaking can be disabled by providing the --no-tree-shake-icons flag when building your app.
Font asset "MaterialIcons-Regular.otf" was tree-shaken, reducing it from 1645184 to 31752 bytes (98.1% reduction). Tree-shaking can be disabled by providing the --no-tree-shake-icons flag when building your app.
Font asset "CupertinoIcons.ttf" was tree-shaken, reducing it from 283452 to 1896 bytes (99.3% reduction). Tree-shaking can be disabled by providing the --no-tree-shake-icons flag when building your app.

```


## Other commands

- `flutter gen-l10n` to generate source code from localization files.
- `flutter pub upgrade` to upgrade packages to a newer minor version.

## Debugging

IDEs with official Flutter plugins are recommended. Otherwise you can still run a Flutter application with `flutter run`, and invoke actions like Hot Reload, or Hot Restart with your keyboard. Dart supports LSP, so IDEs like Kate support linting and showing problems as well.

## Things to try when a build fails

Try clearing caches and existing build files with `flutter clean`. Perhaps generated files are outdated, then you can try running `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`
