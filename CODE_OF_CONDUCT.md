# Code of Conduct

## Core Principles

- Treat others with respect

- Your background does not matter to the mission of the project (in relation to point no. 1)

- We reserve the right to refuse support and fallback to the "software as-is" clause, as stated in [our license](LICENSE).

- We reserve the right to moderate at our own discretion.

## In detail

We explicitly don't allow:

- harassment

  - namecalling, slurs

  - racism, homophobia, transphobia, etc.

  - intentional deadnaming, misgendering

- doxxing & threats

- political and activistic derailing

We won't exclude anyone from contributing, unless...

1. Your contribution is objectively bad or requires too much work to patch it up to be acceptable.

2. Your contribution is too niche or doesn't follow our direction of the project.

3. Your contribution either is with malicious intent or supports harassment or communities that do.
